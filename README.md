# clustering-tweets
This is part of my Data Mining course work on November 2018, done with my colleague Dana Alhenaki

The objective of the project was to cluster Arabic tweets and choose the best clustering algorithm that lead to better distiguished clusters

The phases of the project was:
1. Extract tweets of interest using tweepy library
2. Preprocess these tweets using Arabic NLP libraries to unify related words
3. Apply clustering algorithms using scikit-learn library [k-means, NMF, LDA]
4. Apply the Silhouette Coeffecient to evaluate performance of clustering methods
5. Conclude resutls and wrote a paper
